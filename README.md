# SkateBoardLights

This is the code for my custom lighting system that I use on my Evolve Bamboo GTX electric skateboard. You can find all of the 3D printed files on [thingiverse]() and a more detailed write up on my [blog]().

## Getting started
The code is super simple, just flash it to an arduino or ESP8266 microcontroller and hook up the data pin of your LED strip to pin D5.
